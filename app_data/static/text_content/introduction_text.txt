This little web app is set up as an experiment. We want to evaluate if user chose manually given keywords (set by
humans) for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) over automatically generated ones. The background is that we are
currently working on tools to support teachers and course admins in the generation of metadata. One of these tool is
meant to automatically set keywords for a course.
</p>

<p>
The keyword generation is based on a Large Language Model (LLM). We now want to present the automatically generated
keywords together with keywords and let you choose who did a better job - the teachers and course admins or the AI.

<p>
The task is rather simple: You will be presented with a course title and in some cases a course description. The courses
are randomly chosen from a pool. You will also see two lists of keywords. One containing the keywords that were assigned
to the course by humans the other with keywords generated by the AI. We will <strong>NOT</strong> show you which list
belongs to whom! Your task is to select the list that fits best to the course. This procedure is repeated 10 times.

<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This is about you opinion! There is no right or wrong. Just chose whatever you think is the
best set of keywords for the course.
